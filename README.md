# videography

This project documents my settings and workflow for video shooting, editing, publishing, and storage.

## Video Editing Instructions
#### Transfer videos from phone to mac:
* airdrop to 'downloads' folder
* copy/paste to external harddrive location (T7)
* delete files from 'Downloads' folder
* in Finder, go to 'Finder' and 'Empty Trash' to free up space on mac
* ~~Plug phone into mac (with white usb to usb-c adapter)~~
* ~~Plug SSD into mac ~~
#### For Editing with Final Cut Pro
* Click on your external library in Final Cut Pro (Ex: 2022 NCHS Volleyball)
* Click on File, new Event (ex: 9-3-2022 Intercity)
* Import videos from phone directly onto SSD
* Video Editing
   * add soft beginning and end transitions - go to the little bowtie icon in the lower right screen called transitions. I like Dissolves, Cross Dissolve
   * Zoom - section off your clip using the blade tool, position your head over the selected clip, click on the box in the lower right of the preview screen and select "transform". Use "Scale (all) to zoom in and reposition the clip by dragging the screen in the preview.
   * File, Share, YouTube
#### For direct sharing to YouTube
* If not editing, go to YouTube and select upload content and upload the video directly from the SSD
* Create thumbnail slide in Keynote
* Export to Images (jpeg) - Snagit, save as, save in Dropbox
* Resize images using “Preview” app. Tools -> Adjust size 1024x1024 - Highlight all thumbnails jpegs in Dropbox, right click, open with Preview app
* Upload the thumbnail to YouTube
* Create playlist
* Send email with links to videos and playlist
* Troubleshooting: Some of the videos recorded on 9-3-2022 transferred fine to the external harddrive via the method above and some did not so I had to airdrop them from my phone to my computer, copy from "Downloads" to the T7 and delete it in downloads, and go to "Finder", "Empty Trash". Super annoying - No, now I realized this was not annoying because I learned a better way of doing things. Isn't the universe wonderful?
